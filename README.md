# JavaScript-Templating

# Project On JavaScript Templates 

Under the guidance of Lynda tutorials I have learned about JavaScript Templates. JavaScript templates take simple web apps to 
the next level, keeping your appplication logic separate from your presentation and your HTML and JS files clean. In this 
project I had a look at popular JavaScript template solutions for modern web apps that consume and display data. Also I reviewed
four popular templating libraries. JQuery Template, a simple solution that plugs straight into JQuery. Handlebars and Mustache, 
which provide greater felexibility and Dust, the templating engine for more complex scenerios.
